Some small projects that I have developed with some courses or where I explore, in a more focused way, some specific technology or approach.

## List of projects:

- In this project, I use some Statistical Fundamentals to investigate the Fandango Movie Ratings. This project was a development after the end of the [Statistics Fundamentals](https://app.dataquest.io/view_cert/7Z0SYDIV0Z08LX0CEVN7/) of Dataquest. In this course I have covered the following points:
    - Sampling
    - Variables in Statistics
    - Frequency Distributions
    - Visualizing Frequency Distributions 
    - Comparing Frequency Distributions
- <img height="20" src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/png/512/262/262830.png"> **[**Finding the Best Markets to Advertise In**](https://github.com/VitorSousa5/projects_sm/tree/main/Finding%20the%20Best%20Markets%20to%20Advertise%20In)**
- In this project, I applied the concepts that I learn in the course [Statistics Intermediate: Averages and Variability](https://app.dataquest.io/view_cert/06Z0JC9THPSG6DPKFCEK/) of Dataquest, and I tried to find the best two markets to promote e-learning courses. In the course, and the project, I covered the following points:
  
  - Mean
      - Weighted Mean and the Median
    - Mode
    - Measures of Variability
    - Z-scores
- <img height="20" src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/png/128/1036/1036627.png"> [**Mobile App for Lottery Addiction**](https://github.com/VitorSousa5/projects_sm/tree/main/Mobile%20App%20for%20Lottery%20Addiction)
  - With the outcomes of the course [Probability: Fundamentals](https://app.dataquest.io/view_cert/QJ8O9HGPD1BDW91S67BT/) of Dataquest I develop set of functions that are mostly focused on calculation probabilities. The course and the project help me in:
    - Calculate theoretical and empirical probabilities
    - Use probability rules to solve probability problems
    - Use combinations and permutations
- <img height="20" src="https://www.zyxel.com/library/assets/products/anti-spam/lic-cas_anti-spam_380x380.png"> [**Building a Spam Filter with Naive Bayes**](https://github.com/VitorSousa5/projects_sm/tree/main/Building%20a%20Spam%20Filter%20with%20Naive%20Bayes)
  - With the concepts that I learned in course [Conditional Probability](https://app.dataquest.io/view_cert/WIQMG8V0ZO8SDZTARUJW/) from Dataquest I develop a Spam filter using Naive Bayes. In course I Learn: 
    - What is conditional probability
    - How to assign probabilities based on conditions
    - What is the standard notation for conditional probability

  - In this project I apply the concepts that I learned in course [**Hypothesis Testing**](https://app.dataquest.io/view_cert/R5BC4H9PIVPO713DPROJ/) from Dataquest. I work with a dataset of Jeopardy questions to figure out some patterns in the questions that could help you win. The major competences that I gain during the course and the project where: 
    - How hypothesis testing works
    - How statistical significance and hypothesis testing are related
