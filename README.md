Some small projects that I have developed with some courses or where I explore, in a more focused way, some specific technology or approach.

## List of projects:

- **[Investigating Fandango Movie Ratings](/Investigating Fandango Movie Ratings)**
  - In this project I use some Statistical Fundamentals to investigate the Fandango Movie Ratings. This projects was development after a the end of the [Statistics Fundamentals](https://app.dataquest.io/course/statistics-fundamentals) of Dataquest. In this course I have covered the following points:
    - Sampling 
    - Variables in Statistics
    - Frequency Distributions
    - Visualizing Frequency Distributions
    - Comparing Frequency Distributions
- **[Finding the Best Markets to Advertise In](https://github.com/VitorSousa5/projects_sm/tree/main/Finding%20the%20Best%20Markets%20to%20Advertise%20In)**
  - In this project I applied the concepts that I learn in the course [Statistics Intermediate: Averages and Variability](https://app.dataquest.io/course/statistics-intermediate) of Dataquest, and I tried to find the best two markets to promote e-learning courses. In the course, and in the project, I covered the following points:
    - Mean
    - Weighted Mean and the Median
    - Mode
    - Measures of Variability
