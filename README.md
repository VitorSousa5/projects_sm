Some small projects that I have developed with some courses or where I explore, in a more focused way, some specific technology or approach.

## List of projects:

- <img height="20" src="https://drncvpyikhjv3.cloudfront.net/sites/180/2020/02/14094853/BRL-movies-Icon.png">  [Investigating Fandango Movie Ratings](https://github.com/VitorSousa5/projects_sm/tree/main/Investigating Fandango Movie Ratings)
- In this project, I use some Statistical Fundamentals to investigate the Fandango Movie Ratings. This project was a development after the end of the [Statistics Fundamentals](https://app.dataquest.io/view_cert/7Z0SYDIV0Z08LX0CEVN7/) of Dataquest. In this course I have covered the following points:
    - Sampling
    - Variables in Statistics
    - Frequency Distributions
    - Visualizing Frequency Distributions 
    - Comparing Frequency Distributions

- In this project, I applied the concepts that I learn in the course [Statistics Intermediate: Averages and Variability](https://app.dataquest.io/view_cert/06Z0JC9THPSG6DPKFCEK/) of Dataquest, and I tried to find the best two markets to promote e-learning courses. In the course, and the project, I covered the following points:
  
  - Mean
      - Weighted Mean and the Median
    - Mode
    - Measures of Variability
    - Z-scores
- <img height="20" src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/png/128/1036/1036627.png">**Mobile App for Lottery Addiction**
  - With the outcomes of the course [Probability: Fundamentals](https://app.dataquest.io/view_cert/QJ8O9HGPD1BDW91S67BT/) of Dataquest I develop set of functions that are mostly focused on calculation probabilities. The course and the project help me in:
    - Calculate theoretical and empirical probabilities
    - Use probability rules to solve probability problems
    - Use combinations and permutations
- <img height="20" src="https://www.zyxel.com/library/assets/products/anti-spam/lic-cas_anti-spam_380x380.png">**Building a Spam Filter with Naive Bayes**
  - With the concepts that I learned in course [Conditional Probability](https://app.dataquest.io/view_cert/WIQMG8V0ZO8SDZTARUJW/) from Dataquest I develop a Spam filter using Naive Bayes. In course I Learn: 
    - What is conditional probability
    - How to assign probabilities based on conditions
    - What is the standard notation for conditional probability
